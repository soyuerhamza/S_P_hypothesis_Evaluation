# S&P 500 Companies Long-Term Analysis

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive long-term analysis of S&P 500 companies, with a focus on Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL). The analysis utilizes Excel statistics to assess and maintain historical stock data and performance trends.

## Data Sources

The live stock data for MSFT, TSLA, and AAPL has been extracted from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from 2018 to 2023 on a daily basis. The dataset also includes S&P 500 values during the same time frame. Percentage changes in stock values (%change) have been calculated and presented in the dataset.

## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The analysis incorporates the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to determine the relative risk of each stock. The slope coefficient Beta in a simple regression of the excess return on the stock versus the stock return on the market (S&P 500) is calculated. A higher Beta indicates higher risk and potential for higher returns in the market.
